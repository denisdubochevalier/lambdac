# The Cardinal Laws of Collaboration: An Opus for Conducing Contributions to λ.c

Salutations, esteemed contributors and gallant guardians of the λ.c odyssey.
Your intellectual investiture and technical talents enrich the wellspring of
this grand endeavor. However, such a collective voyage necessitates a set of
decorous conventions—a codex that governs the intricate ballet of code and
community. Behold, the cardinal laws of collaboration.

## Preliminary Discourse: The Conduit of Communication

Prior to weaving your ingenuity into the codebase or shaping the theoretical
contours of λ.c, one must initiate a dialogue—a dialectic if you will—with the
curators of this project. Whether through the forum of GitHub issues, the
formality of electronic mail, or alternative channels of discourse, this
preliminary consultation is requisite.

## Ethical Compact: The Codex of Civility

In the fecund pastures of intellectual exchange, it is incumbent upon all
individuals to abide by an ethical compact that engenders a congenial and
inclusive milieu. This encompasses but is not limited to:

- The employment of inclusive and genial verbiage
- A deference to the plurality of opinions and experiences
- Receptive comportment to constructive critique
- Fidelity to the collective interests and ethos of the λ.c community
- A pervasive empathy towards all consociates

Detailed prescriptions and proscriptions are elucidated in the subsequent
sections.

## Exegesis of the Pull Request Process

1. **Purification of Dependencies**: Assiduously expunge any lingering build or
   installation dependencies prior to the completion of your contributions.
2. **Chronicles in README**: Amend the README.md to reflect alterations to the
   interface, divulging newly-introduced variables, ports, files, or other
   pertinent paradigms.
3. **Numerical Ascendancy**: Align the version numbers within example files and
   README.md in accordance with the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) nomenclature to
   represent the novel changes.
4. **The Merging Liturgy**: The Pull Request may ascend to the celestial realms
   of the `master` branch upon the benedictions of no fewer than two fellow
   developers. If such permissions elude you, beseech a second reviewer to enact
   the merging ritual.

## Code of Civility: Ethical Compact Detailed

- **The Covenant**: In the fertile lands of λ.c, all must abide by a covenant
  that banishes harassment and fosters inclusivity, irrespective of biological,
  sociological, or ideological facets.

- **The Consequences**: Custodians of the project reserve the right to excise,
  modify, or rebuff contributions that flout this covenant, or to castigate
  contributors via temporary or perpetual exile.

- **The Jurisdiction**: This ethical compact reigns supreme within all spheres
  where an individual assumes the mantle of λ.c representation, both virtual and
  corporeal.

## Instruments of Enforcement

Incidents violating the sanctity of this code may be reported to the coterie of
λ.c maintainers at <contact@denischevalier.fr>. All entreaties will
be investigated with utmost impartiality and confidentiality.

Project overseers who eschew the enforcement of this Code of Civility may incur
retributive actions as meted out by the project’s leadership.

## Source of Inspiration

This ethical compact is inspired by the venerated
[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4, available
for perusal at [this location](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

May these guidelines serve as the illuminated manuscript that guides our
collective endeavor, assuring that λ.c matures as both an exemplar of
computational excellence and a paragon of collaborative virtuousness.
