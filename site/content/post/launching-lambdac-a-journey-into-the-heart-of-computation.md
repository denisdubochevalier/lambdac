Greetings, illustrious seekers of computational purity and aficionados of
mathematical elegance. Allow me to extend a warm invitation to the cerebral
odyssey that is λ.c—a programming language fusing the timeworn splendors of
untyped lambda calculus with the exigencies of contemporary software
development.

## The Genesis of λ.c: Why Stir the Aether?

One cannot peruse the annals of computational theory without crossing paths with
the visionary work of Alonzo Church—the father of lambda calculus. Though
conceived in the 1930s, this austere language of abstraction forms the bedrock
upon which modern computational leviathans like _Haskell_ and _Common Lisp_ are
erected. Yet, it remains ensconced in theoretical lore, seldom breaking the
surface into mainstream use, ostensibly due to its unadulterated minimalism.

As I traversed the corridors of my intellectual pursuits and engineering
experiments, an epiphany alighted upon me—the possibility of breathing life into
a programming language that marries the purity of lambda calculus with pragmatic
embellishments for practical deployments. Thus was born λ.c, an offering to the
computational deities that venerates minimalism, champions first-class
functions, and lends itself to intuitive notations through a mix of Polish
syntax and currying.

## Guiding Tenets: The Philosophical Cornerstones

It behooves us to elucidate the guiding imperatives that propel this endeavor:

1. **Elegance in Simplicity**: To hew closely to the original syntax of lambda
   calculus, albeit with nuanced modifications that engender practical utility.
2. **Canonical Combinators**: To endow each program with an arsenal of venerable
   combinators—K, S, C, and the like—out of the box.
3. **Modular Grandeur**: To architect a hierarchical tapestry for modules that
   bring forth common computational artifacts, from the banalities of Church
   Literals to the complexities of IO and Networking.
4. **Type System Abeyance**: To refrain from imposing a type system initially,
   leaving open the tantalizing prospect of its future inclusion.
5. **Recursive Genesis**: To culminate in a self-hosting compiler, reifying λ.c
   within its own existential framework.

## Current Alchemy: The Crucible's Contents

As of this moment, λ.c is embryonic—its metaphysical form still materializing
within the crucible of planning and specification. The vaults of its GitHub
sanctuary are aflutter with drafts, musings, and roadmaps that hint at a
tantalizing journey ahead.

## A Clarion Call: Your Role in This Cerebral Voyage

This expedition seeks fellow travelers, be they scholars, engineers, or
laypersons intrigued by computational philosophy:

1. **Illumination through Feedback**: Engage in
   [discourse](https://github.com/denisdubochevalier/lambdac/issues) that will
   influence the trajectory of λ.c's evolving metaphysics.
2. **Documentation as Scripture**: Participate in
   [chronicling](https://github.com/denisdubochevalier/lambdac/tree/main/site)
   the annals of this new dialect, rendering it comprehensible for posterity.
3. **The Craftsmanship of Code**: Involve yourself directly in the
   [transmutation of theory to code](https://github.com/denisdubochevalier/lambdac/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
   breathing functionality into abstract constructs.
4. **The Rigor of Testing**: Lend your faculties to the validation and
   fortification of λ.c, ensuring its resilience against the tempests of
   computational dilemmas.

## Epilogue: The Road Unraveled, The Path Ahead

As I stand on the precipice of this grand undertaking, buoyed by a blend of
trepidation and exultation, I extend my deepest gratitude for your investment in
λ.c. May this journal serve as a lodestar guiding us through the labyrinthine
complexity and sublime simplicity that epitomize computational theory. The
[GitHub sanctuary](https://github.com/denisdubochevalier/lambdac) awaits your
presence. Until our next scholarly rendezvous, let the quest for computational
enlightenment commence!
