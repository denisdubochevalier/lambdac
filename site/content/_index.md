# The Alchemy of Simplicity: λ.c

Embark on a cerebral expedition through the minimalist landscape of lambda
calculus, brought to life by the elegance of Go. λ.c is not just a compiler; it
is an odyssey through the origin stories of computation itself.

## Project Chronology: Nascent Ideation

As we tread the first cobblestones of this grand boulevard, be aware that λ.c is
in its foundational stages. Your exploration with us is not only welcomed but
also crucial in shaping the experiment. By daring to delve into its nascent
architecture, you contribute to a collective gestalt of computational wisdom.

## Allegory & Conception

Prepare for a sojourn through λ.c—a computing paradigm where the ethereal
concepts of untyped lambda calculus manifest in tangible form. Though realized
in Go, λ.c pays homage to Alonzo Church's groundbreaking 1930s theoretic,
distilling complex computations into purist, functional abstractions.

Dabble in the elixir of clean, intuitive syntax. Embrace the sublime
choreography of functions—as the lead dancers in this computational ballet.
Polish notation coalesces with currying to illuminate your code as in `+ 1 2`, a
delightful analogue to `(add 1) 2` in a curried world.

Here, within this virtual atelier, we unfurl a rolling tapestry of blog posts,
conceptual exegeses, and passionate colloquies—each a facet in the prism through
which λ.c refracts.

## Installation Rites

Initiate your journey with λ.c by executing these sacred commands:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:denisdubochevalier/lambdac.git
$ cd lambdac
$ make && make install
```

## Guild of Contributors

Join our collective enterprise by following these rites of passage:

1. Fork this sanctuary of code.
2. Baptize your branch with a meaningful moniker: `git checkout -b my-quest`.
3. Chronicle your changes: `git commit -am 'Add a vial of wisdom'`. 4, Share
   your incantations: `git push origin my-quest`. 5, Unfurl your scroll of
   amendments via a pull request.
