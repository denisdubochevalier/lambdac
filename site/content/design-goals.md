Lambda calculus serves as the Platonic Ideal in the realm of mathematical logic
and computation theory. It distills the essence of computation to its most
abstract, dealing in the pure alchemy of function abstraction and application,
bound and liberated by variables and substitution.

## Project Ambitions: Sculpting the Quarks of Computation

In the grand tapestry of computational tools, few compilers dare to pare down
their features to the point of austere elegance. λ.c is an artistic deviation—an
ontological project that endeavors to create a minimalist yet fully-functioning
compiler for untyped lambda calculus.

This project doesn't merely serve as a bridge between theory and application; it
exists as a medium to experience the transcendental beauty of foundational
mathematics. λ.c offers a reductive landscape where simplicity doesn't impede
functionality but amplifies it. In fact, the project's philosophical grounding
is in its dedication to minimality while not sacrificing the constructs
necessary for practical computation.

## Anticipated Features

As the architect behind this labyrinth of logic, I have defined a roadmap that
adheres to the principles of minimalism and functional purity, aiming to endow
λ.c with the following capabilities:

- **Lexical Proximity to Theoretical Origins**: Utilizing \ as a syntactic
  surrogate for the lambda symbol, thereby paying homage to the formalism's
  historical roots.

- **Cognitive Synergy via a Standard Library**: A curated ensemble of
  pre-defined combinators (K, S, C, etc.) along with an assortment of data
  structures (Church Literals, Tuples, Lists, Real and Complex Numbers) form the
  language's intellectual bedrock. Taking a step further into the realms of
  practicality without violating its minimalist ethos, λ.c will also
  incorporates IO and networking capabilities.

- **Modularity through Hierarchical Design**: Enabling a module import system
  rooted in a directory hierarchy, thereby offering a mechanism for
  incorporating custom modules without the convolution of a package manager.

- **Recursive Self-Realization**: The ultimate aspiration—crafting a
  self-hosting compiler, a sort of ontological recursion where λ.c can
  re-implement itself within the confines of its own syntax and semantics.

## The Voyage Ahead: An Open Path, Yet Defined

Presently, the cornerstone of the compiler—a functional lexer—stands complete.
What lies ahead on the roadmap is the construction of the Abstract Syntax Tree
(AST), a representational framework pivotal for the compilation process.

Beyond this lies fertile ground, yet to be charted. Potential endeavors could
include but are not limited to:

- **Optimization Engine**: Implementing peephole or dead code elimination
  strategies to enhance performance.

- **Interoperability**: Crafting a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that would
  allow λ.c to interact seamlessly with C or other languages, creating a bridge
  between the minimalistic and the pragmatic.

- **Metaprogramming and Reflection**: Introduce features that enable the
  language to be aware of its own structure and modify it during runtime, a
  veritable self-contemplation within the computational realm.

I invite you to join me in this journey—whether your interest is academic,
philosophical, or purely driven by the challenge of mastering minimalist design
in a realm often dominated by the complexities of feature bloat. Together, let
us explore the very atoms of computational theory through the crystalline lens
of λ.c.
